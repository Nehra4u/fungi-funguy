\f1\i0 , commonly known as the 
\f2\b common ink cap
\f1\b0  or 
\f2\b inky cap
\f1\b0 , is an edible (but sometimes poisonous, when combined with alcohol) mushroom found in Europe and North America. Previously known as 
\f0\i Coprinus atramentarius
\f1\i0 , it is the second best known ink cap and previous member of the genus {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprinus"}}{\fldrslt 
\f0\i \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Coprinus}} after {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprinus_comatus"}}{\fldrslt 
\f0\i \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 C.\'a0comatus}}. It is a widespread and common {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 fungus}} found throughout the northern hemisphere. Clumps of mushrooms arise after rain from spring to autumn, commonly in urban and disturbed habitats such as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_lot"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 vacant lots}} and lawns, as well as grassy areas. The grey-brown {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pileus_(mycology)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 cap}} is initially bell-shaped before opening, after which it flattens and disintegrates. The flesh is thin and the taste mild. It can be eaten but is {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 poisonous}} when consumed with {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholic_beverage"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 alcohol}} \'96 hence another common name,
