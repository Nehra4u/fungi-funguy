\f1\i0  ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Latin}} for 'Judas's Ear'), known as the

\f1\b0  or by a number of other {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_name"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 common names}}, is a species of edible {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auriculariales"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Auriculariales}} fungus found worldwide. The {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basidiocarp"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 fruiting body}} is distinguished by its noticeably ear-like shape and brown colouration; it grows upon wood, especially {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elder_tree"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 elder}}. Its {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specific_name_(botany)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 specific epithet}} is derived from the belief that {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_Iscariot"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Judas Iscariot}} hanged himself from an {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sambucus"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 elder tree}}; the Latin 
\f0\i Judae
\f1\i0  ('Judas's') was mistranslated into English as 'Jew's', leading to the term "Jew's ear", while today "jelly ear" and other names are sometimes used. The fungus can be found throughout the year in temperate regions worldwide, where it grows upon both dead and living wood. \
In the West, 
\f0\i A.\'a0auricula-judae
\f1\i0  was used in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_medicine"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 folk medicine}} as recently as the 19th century for complaints including {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sore_throat"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 sore throats}}, sore eyes and {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaundice"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 jaundice}}, and as an {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astringent"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 astringent}}. Although it is not widely consumed in the West, it has long been popular in China, to the extent that Australia exported large volumes to China in the early twentieth century. Today, the fungus is a popular ingredient in many Chinese dishes, such as {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_and_sour_soup"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 hot and sour soup}}, and also used in {\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_Chinese_medicine"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Chinese medicine}}. It is also used in Ghana, as a blood tonic. Modern research into possible medical applications has variously concluded that
